# Complete-AI-assitant-on-a-tiny-microcontroller---XIAO-ESP32-S3-sense
A compact AI voice assistant built on the XIAO ESP32 S3 Sense — featuring Gemini AI, Speech-to-Text, and Text-to-Speech in pure C++.
🎙️ ESP32 S3 Sense – Smart AI Voice Assistant

A tiny but powerful AI voice assistant built using the XIAO ESP32 S3 Sense.
It listens, understands, and speaks — all packed into a small board with a built-in microphone and PSRAM!

🚀 Overview

This project turns your ESP32 S3 Sense into a complete voice assistant powered by:

🧠 Gemini AI for intelligent responses

🗣️ Speech-to-Text (STT) for recognizing your voice

🔊 Text-to-Speech (TTS) for speaking answers out loud

Everything runs on-device through C++ and the Arduino environment — fast, compact, and surprisingly powerful.

⚡ Features

🎤 Real-time voice recognition using an I²S microphone

💬 Smart replies via Gemini

🔈 Natural speech playback through TTS

🧩 Modular design (easy to extend for robot control, sensors, or IoT)

🧠 OPI PSRAM support for smooth multitasking and zero freezes

⚙️ Fully open-source and customizable
